Memory Manager
Overview
The MemoryManager is a custom memory management system designed to provide efficient memory allocation and deallocation for applications. This system allows you to manage memory dynamically with greater control, using custom strategies for allocation and deallocation.

Features
Custom Allocation: Manages memory allocation and deallocation through a custom strategy.
Deallocation Tracking: Ensures that memory is properly deallocated and reused.
Memory Pools: Supports the use of memory pools for efficient allocation and deallocation.
Getting Started
Installation
Clone the Repository

bash
Code kopieren
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
Build the Project

Follow the instructions for building the project. This typically involves using a build system such as make, cmake, or another build tool specific to your environment.

bash
Code kopieren
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
Usage
Include the Header

Include the MemoryManager.h header file in your project.

cpp
Code kopieren
#include "MemoryManager.h"
Create an Instance of MemoryManager

Instantiate the MemoryManager object in your application.

cpp
Code kopieren
MemoryManager memoryManager;
Allocate Memory

Use the allocate method to request memory.

cpp
Code kopieren
void* ptr = memoryManager.allocate(sizeof(int));
Deallocate Memory

Use the deallocate method to return memory to the manager.

cpp
Code kopieren
memoryManager.deallocate(ptr);
Handle Errors

Ensure to check for null pointers or handle any potential errors related to memory allocation.

Example
Here is a simple example of using the MemoryManager:

cpp
Code kopieren
#include "MemoryManager.h"
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    MemoryManager memoryManager;

    // Allocate memory
    int* num = static_cast<int*>(memoryManager.allocate(sizeof(int)));
    if (num == nullptr) {
        std::cerr << "Memory allocation failed!" << std::endl;
        return 1;
    }

    // Use the allocated memory
    *num = 42;
    std::cout << "Number: " << *num << std::endl;

    // Deallocate memory
    memoryManager.deallocate(num);

    return 0;
}
Implementation Details
MemoryManager.h
Contains the declaration of the MemoryManager class, including methods for allocation and deallocation.

MemoryManager.cpp
Contains the implementation of the MemoryManager methods, including the logic for allocating and deallocating memory.

Design Considerations
Custom Allocation Strategy: You may choose to implement custom allocation strategies, such as memory pools or reference counting.
Thread Safety: Ensure thread safety if the MemoryManager will be used in multi-threaded applications.
Extending the Memory Manager
To extend or modify the MemoryManager, follow these guidelines:

Add New Allocation Strategies: Implement new allocation strategies in the MemoryManager.cpp file.
Optimize Performance: Profile and optimize the memory management code as needed.
Handle Special Cases: Implement additional logic to handle special memory management scenarios.
